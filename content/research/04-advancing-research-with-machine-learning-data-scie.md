<p>The power of modern machine learning and data science opens new avenues for understanding the human mind and society. This research area is dedicated to:</p><ul><li><strong>Developing Novel Computational Methods:</strong> We create and refine <strong>innovative representation learning models, sophisticated probabilistic models (including Bayesian approaches), and advanced social simulation techniques.</strong> These tools are designed to support and advance research across a wide spectrum of disciplines, including <strong>cognitive science, science communication, media studies, education, and other crucial social science fields.</strong></li><li><strong>Building and Maintaining Large-Scale Datasets:</strong> Recognizing that empirical research thrives on robust data, we are also committed to <strong>developing, curating, and maintaining large-scale datasets.</strong> These resources serve as critical infrastructure to empower a wide range of empirical studies within computational social science, both within our lab and for the broader research community.</li></ul><p>This foundational work is crucial for pushing the boundaries of what's knowable in social and cognitive sciences, and we seek collaborators and students eager to contribute to methodological innovation and data infrastructure development.</p>
