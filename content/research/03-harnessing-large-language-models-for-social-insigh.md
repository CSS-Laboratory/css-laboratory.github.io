<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented capabilities for social science research. Our work in this area focuses on two key thrusts:</p><ul><li><strong>Innovative Methodologies for Qualitative Analysis:</strong> We explore how LLMs can revolutionize traditionally time-consuming and labor-intensive qualitative research by developing techniques for <strong>surrogate labeling, conducting simulated psychological experiments, and enabling 'silicon sampling' (using LLMs as sophisticated proxies for human interviewees).</strong> The goal is to accelerate research cycles and broaden the scope of qualitative inquiry.</li><li><strong>Understanding LLM Cognition and Values:</strong> Beyond application, we delve into the <strong>fundamental cognitive mechanisms and embedded value systems of LLMs themselves.</strong> A critical part of this research is to identify and analyze the <strong>commonalities and crucial differences between human cognitive frameworks and the underlying 'cognitive' features of these powerful AI models.</strong></li></ul><p>We are committed to <strong>working closely with industry stakeholders</strong> to ensure our research generates not only significant academic contributions but also <strong>practical insights that can empower new businesses and applications.</strong> We welcome students and collaborators keen on exploring the frontiers of AI in social science, AI ethics, and human-AI interaction.</p>
