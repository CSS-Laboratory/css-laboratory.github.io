<p>What drives the evolution of cultural tastes, and how do creative trends emerge and fade? This research explores the underlying mechanisms of cultural change by analyzing <strong>extensive metadata from diverse cultural domains</strong>. This includes hundreds of thousands of records from <strong>mainstream manga, anime, fiction (novels, SCP Foundation entries, urban legends), and Vocaloid music, alongside millions of metadata entries from pornographic comics.</strong></p><p>Our primary aim is to understand <strong>how cultural products evolve and to uncover the fundamental principles of cultural dynamics.</strong> We approach this by:</p><ul><li>Employing <strong>sociophysics models and network science approaches</strong> to map and analyze the relationships and influences within cultural ecosystems.</li><li>Using popular culture as a unique lens to examine the <strong>dynamic interplay between human creativity and its broader cultural context.</strong></li></ul><p>This research offers exciting opportunities for those interested in quantitative analysis of culture, network modeling, and exploring the deep structures that shape our collective creative output.</p>
