We analyze <strong>massive datasets</strong> from platforms like <strong>Yahoo! News Japan</strong> (millions of news items, hundreds of millions of comments), <strong>Wikipedia</strong> (millions of revisions across multiple languages), and <strong>YouTube</strong> (spanning 10 nations with millions of videos and tens of millions of comments). Our investigations focus on critical societal issues, including:</p><ul><li>The <strong>dynamics of online discourse</strong> surrounding pivotal events like climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and other major disasters.</li><li>The mechanisms behind the <strong>emergence and spread of conspiracy theories</strong> and misinformation.</li><li>The societal impacts and online manifestations of <strong>geopolitical conflicts, political polarization, and disruptive technological innovations.</strong></li></ul><p>To understand how these online narratives unfold and exert influence, we employ sophisticated <strong>representation learning techniques, causal inference methodologies, and advanced machine learning models.</strong> A key goal is to translate our findings into <strong>actionable insights for stakeholders and policymakers</strong>, potentially informing interventions and strategies for a healthier information environment. We are looking for students and collaborators interested in large-scale data analysis, NLP, and understanding the societal impact of online platforms.</p>",
